# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Mavis Javier**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**MyCoffee API** is an android app that **This app displays information taken from a <a href="https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/hot" target="_blank">Sample API</a>'s hot coffee JSON. It displays the coffee name, its image, and its description**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòù‚òïü§©**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **<a href="https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/hot" target="_blank">Sample API Hot Coffee</a>**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Creating functions in Kotlin is very similar to creating functions in Java and JS. Creating mobile apps and web apps are quite similar in my opinion.
